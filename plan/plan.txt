  - Fingerprint as optional enhancement
  - Worker choice: QR only, Fingerprint only, or Both
  - Seamless fallback between methods

3. Database Schema Enhancements
New tables and fields to support fingerprint authentication:

‚Ä¢ Workers Table Updates:
  - preferredAttendanceMethod (qr_code/fingerprint/both)
  - fingerprintEnabled (boolean flag)

‚Ä¢ Attendance Table Updates:
  - attendanceMethod (tracks which method was used)
  - fingerprintMatchScore (confidence score)

‚Ä¢ New fingerprintTemplates Table:
  - Encrypted fingerprint templates per worker
  - Multiple finger support (index 0-9)
  - Quality scores and usage tracking
  - Active/inactive template management

4. Enhanced User Experience
Mobile-optimized attendance workflow:

‚Ä¢ Settings Panel:
  - Attendance method selection interface
  - Fingerprint enrollment management
  - Method status indicators
  - Security and privacy controls

‚Ä¢ Attendance Flow:
  - Method selection at check-in
  - Quick authentication (QR scan or fingerprint)
  - Immediate feedback and confirmation
  - Geolocation verification

‚Ä¢ Dashboard Features:
  - Real-time attendance status
  - Method-specific analytics
  - Enhanced mobile QR scanning
  - Push notifications for reminders
