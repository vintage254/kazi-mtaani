Looking at the worker pages, I can see that only the attendance page (WorkerAttendanceClient) has mobile responsiveness implemented. The other worker pages - dashboard, groups, and profile - are still using only WorkerSidebar with fixed desktop layouts.

Current Issue:
Dashboard, Groups, and Profile pages use fixed ml-64 (left margin) assuming sidebar is always visible
Only WorkerSidebar is used, which isn't mobile-friendly
MobileNavigation
 component exists but isn't implemented across all worker pages
